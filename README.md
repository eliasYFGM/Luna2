# Luna 2
This is an open-source remake of the creepypasta game "Luna 2" (or Luna Game 2) in the C language, started as a small tribute to the "Luna Game" series after 5 years of its first release in 2011.

## Compilation

### Linux
This is the default target. You need to install Code::Blocks and Allegro 5 development packages in order to compile and build. You can use MinGW32 or MinGW-w64 to target Windows.

### Windows
Be sure to have Code::Blocks installed and change the linker options to fit your current configuration. You will need to build Allegro 5 yourself with CMAKE if you don't have the binaries that correspond with your GCC version.

At least Allegro 5.0 is required, with acodec (+ ogg/vorbis support), audio, image, font and primitives.
