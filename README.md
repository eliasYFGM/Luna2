# Luna 2
This is a small project that I started as a "tribute" to the Luna Game series, after 5 years of its first release.

Basically a clone of Luna 2 (or Luna Game 2), remade in C with better movement and physics.

## Compilation

The default compilation process is done through Code::Blocks, under Linux. It can also target Windows if you have the cross-compiler tools MinGW32 or MinGW-w64 installed.

At least Allegro 5.0 is required, along with acodec (with ogg support), audio, image, font and primitives addons.
