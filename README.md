# Luna 2
This is an open-source remake of the creepypasta game "Luna 2" (or Luna Game 2) in the C language, with better movement and physics.

I started this project as a small tribute to the Luna Game series, after 5 years of its first release in 2011.

## Compilation

Compilation is done through Code::Blocks under Linux. It can also target Windows if you have the cross-compiler tools MinGW32 or MinGW-w64 installed.

If you are using Windows, be sure to have Code::Blocks installed and change the linker options to fit your current configuration.

At least Allegro 5.0 is required, with acodec (+ ogg/vorbis support), audio, image, font and primitives addons.
